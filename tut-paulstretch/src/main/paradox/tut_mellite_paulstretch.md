# Mllt1 - Paul Stretch

This tutorial shows you how to develop a basic workspace in Mellite. We will be writing a non-realtime signal
processing program ( _FScape_ ) and wire it up with a simple user interface ( _Widget_ ). We use as example the
_Paul Stretch_ algorithm, named after its creator Nasca Octavian Paul and originally
@link:[a standalone software](http://hypermammut.sourceforge.net/paulstretch/) { open=new }
to perform "extreme" time stretching of sounds and additional spectral transformations. Paul has since released
@link:[a public domain version](https://github.com/paulnasca/paulstretch_python) { open=new } of the stripped down
stretching algorithm written in Python. The idea is very simple but remarkably effective: An input sound is stretched 
by taking "segments" (windows) overlapping in time, calculating their spectra (Fourier transform), randomising 
the phase information, resynthesising the time domains segments and putting them back together with an "overlap-add" 
operation, using a larger stepping size than in the analysis. This is illustrated in the following diagram provided 
by Paul:

This tutorial is structured as follows:

- First, we give a from-scratch introduction on how to get started in Mellite, how to create and populate a
  workspace. If you are already familiar with these, you can skip this section.
- Next, we'll run an example to understand how to compile and render FScape programs.
- Then we learn how to import audio files into a workspace.
- The fourth section develops an intuition about transforming an audio file with FScape
- The fifth and last section actually implements the Paul-Stretch algorithm

## Creating a New Workspace

Assuming that you have downloaded and launched Mellite, the first thing to do is create a new _workspace_.

@@@ note

A workspace in Mellite is the document that contains all objects belonging to a project. Technically, a workspace is 
a database on the file system, taking the form of a directory ending in `.mllt` by convention. You can think of the 
workspace as a PD or Max project, for example their main patch and the related abstractions, or as a SuperCollider
`.scd` document. In contrast to PD, Max, and SuperCollider, manipulations in a workspace are always performed directly 
on the database, so there is no "unsaved" document state and no explicit save operation.

@@@

To create a new workspace, choose _File → New → Workspace…_ from the main window's menu,
and in the subsequent dialog select the default option _Durable_, 
after which you are prompted to choose the name and location of the workspace on your file system:

![Menu Item for New Workspace](.../tut-paulstretch-menu-new-workspace.png)

![Dialog for New Workspace](.../tut-paulstretch-dlg-new-workspace.png)

![File-Chooser for New Workspace](.../tut-paulstretch-filechooser-new-workspace.png)

For example, we could name the workspace `PaulStretchTutorial` and save it inside the documents directory in your
home directory.

@@@ note { title=Tip }

Because all operations are performed on the file system, choosing a location on an SSD is preferable
over a traditional hard disk.

@@@

The top element of a workspace is a so-called _Folder_. It is simply a list of elements, and you can nest folders
inside folders to obtain a tree-like structure. You can think of a folder as a PD or Max patch, only that objects
have no visual position within the patch but are just itemised as a list. Since we just created a new workspace,
that list is initially empty. You can add new objects by clicking on the button with plus-shaped icon and choosing
from the popup menu _Composition → FScape_:

![Popup for New Object](.../tut-paulstretch-popup-folder-new-object.png)

This is followed by prompting a name for the new object. This is like naming a variable---since you may have multiple
_FScape_ programs, you distinguish them by name. Let's just use the default name "FScape" for now, and confirm the
dialog:
 
![Popup for New Object](.../tut-paulstretch-new-fscape-name.png)

You now see a new object in the main workspace window. It is an empty program, in order to write our signal
processing code, we have to select it with the mouse or cursor keys and click on the button with the eye-shaped icon
to open its editor:

![Popup for New Object](.../tut-paulstretch-fscape-in-folder.png)

## Giving FScape a Spin

The code editor in Mellite is provided by a light-weight component modelled loosely
after the popular IntelliJ IDEA software---much less powerful, but sharing some of its visual cues and keyboard 
shortcuts.

@@@ note { title=Tip }

If you are new to this editor, it is advised that you take a look at the keyboard shortcuts, which can be found
in the menu _Help → Keyboard Shortcuts_ in Mellite's main window.

@@@

Before we type any code ourselves, we begin by using a built-in example of an FScape program. It generates and
plots a sine wave. To get the code of this example, select the _Examples → Plot Sine_ menu item:

![Popup for New Object](.../tut-paulstretch-fscape-plot-sine-code.png)

Like all code in Mellite, it is written in the
@link:[Scala programming language](https://www.scala-lang.org/) { open=new }, although we use different domain
specific abstractions depending on the type of object. Here we use the signal processing toolkit FScape with its
own set of available elements and rules. For example, as opposed to a "fully fledged" Scala program, we can
write FScape code here directly on the "top level" without wrapping it inside an `object` or `class`, and also we
do not need `import` statements for the commonly used symbols.

As we go through the code, there will be extra boxes explaining bits of the
Scala language to you. __If you are already familiar with Scala, you can simply skip these boxes.__
Here is that example code again in text form:

```scala
val sr  = 44100.0
val sig = SinOsc(440 / sr)
Plot1D(sig, 500)
```

@@@ note { title=Scala }

You can place a statement in each line without having to use a terminal character such as `;`.
You only need a semicolon if you want to place multiple statements in the same line. Values and expressions
can be assigned to variables in the form of `val name = expression`. Conventionally, you would use "camel-case"
names for variables, beginning with a lower-case character.

@@@

Since FScape calculates "as fast as possible" without being tied to real-time sound output, there is no given
@link:[sampling rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)#Sampling_rate), the number of digital
samples per second in the sound signal. If a program generates sound
"from scratch", you would normally define a suitable sampling rate, or if a program transforms an input sound file,
you would normally use that sound file's existing sampling rate. Common sampling rates are 44.1 kHz (44100 Hz) and
48 kHz (48000 Hz). The first line, `val sr = 44100.0` defines a variable for the sampling rate that we can then use
subsequently.

The second line `val sig = SinOsc(440 / sr)` creates a so-called
@link:[unit generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_generator) (UGen), in this case a sine oscillator. Whereas in
real-time systems, you typically specify its frequency in Hertz, for example using `[osc~ 440]` in PD, `[cycle~ 440]`
in Max, or `SinOsc.ar(440)` in SuperCollider, in FScape you give the __normalized frequency__, which means that you
divide the nominal frequency in Hertz by the sampling rate---precisely, because FScape does not know what the
sampling rate is. For the same reason, there is no distinction between audio-rate and control-rate as in SuperCollider.

The third line `Plot1D(sig, 500)` introduces a unit generator that plots the first 500 values of the sine oscillator
when the program is run.

@@@ note

`Plot1D` is really just a tool for debugging, as it currently blocks the further execution
of the program. In the future, visualisations will be much better integrated into FScape.

@@@

To _run_ this program, we need to understand the buttons at the bottom of the editor window, namely
_Apply_, _Compile_, and _Render_. Code snippets in Mellite exists always in two forms:
__Source code__ and __compiled program__ (Scala is a compiled language). Furthermore, when you edit code in the text
editor, the changes only exist in a temporary __buffer__ and have to be explicitly applied, as if the updated source 
code was "saved". Thus if you tried to close the editor window now, you would see a dialog warning you that you have
"unsaved" changes. The _Compile_ button can be used to __test__ whether the current buffer (editor content) is a
valid program. When you click that button, it should take a moment to compile and return with either a green
mark (program is valid) or a red mark (errors). In the case of errors, these are also printed to the log window.
You rarely need to use the _Compile_ button, because the editor automatically test-compiles your code in the
background as you edit, indicating the state on the right-hand side of the window. The tiny green square in the
screenshot above indicates that the program is valid. If you introduce errors, these will be indicated by red
marks. For example, if we left out the second argument of `Plot1D` and just wrote `Plot1D(sig)`, we would see a
compilation error:

![Compilation Error in FScape Code Editor](.../tut-paulstretch-fscape-plot-sine-error.png)

The error reads something like

> error: not enough arguments for method apply: (in: GE, size: GE, label: String)Plot1D in object Plot1D

We can undo the last edit using <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd> (Mac: <kbd>cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Z</kbd>).
If the program is valid, we can save both source code and the compiled program by clicking on the _Apply_ button.
When this button is disabled (shown in faint colours), it means the current buffer has been saved.

@@@ warning {title=Bug }

Sometimes the _Apply_ button is not shown disabled even after saving.

@@@

@@@ note

It is currently not possible to save just the source code if the program is invalid. This will be fixed in a future
version. As a work-around, you can place a block comment `/* ... */` around your code to be able to save and exit
the editor while your program is still invalid (the compiled program will be empty in this case).

@@@

Finally, to run the program, we press the _Render_ button. It is important to understand that this will run the
__last saved compiled program__, so if you forgot to save you might be actually running a previously
saved version, not the one corresponding to the current buffer! The output should be the plot window showing the
first 500 sample values of the sine oscillator:

![Compilation Error in FScape Code Editor](.../tut-paulstretch-fscape-plot-sine-output.png)

As you can see, the signal range is between -1.0 and +1.0, corresponding with the approach of most other signal
processing software, including PD, Max, and SuperCollider.

## Adding an Audio File to the Workspace

The next thing we want to do, is add an audio file to the workspace that we can use as input for our 
FScape program-to-be. Here is a two seconds bell-like sound placed in the
public domain:

<audio controls>
  <source src="337048_131348kaonayabell.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>

You can right-click on the sound player element in the browser and select _Save Audio As_ in the popup menu
to obtain a local copy of this sound. Note that the file format is uncompressed WAV!

@@@ note

While Mellite can export compressed formats such as mp3 or FLAC, it currently only handles uncompressed or 'PCM'
formats as input, typically AIFF or WAV files. If you have mp3, FLAC or Ogg files, you must convert them to be able
to use them in Mellite.

@@@

The easiest way to get the input audio file, is to add it first to the main workspace folder, and from there
make the connection to the attribute map. Therefore, go back to the main workspace window, press the plus
button again, and this time select _Audio File_. A file chooser opens, navigate to the WAV file downloaded, select
it and press _Open_. A second file chooser opens, prompting you:

> Choose Artifact Base Location

Because this is the first "external resource" you add to the workspace, Mellite wants to know what your base
directory for audio files is. Every audio file you add is relative to one of these locations (directories). Just
stick to the default suggestion here by simply confirming with _Open_ again. Two new elements should have been
added now to your workspace folder, the location and the audio file itself:

![Compilation Error in FScape Code Editor](.../tut-paulstretch-audio-file-in-folder.png)

If you select the audio file and press the eye button, a viewer opens with the sonogram of the sound and
a transport bar to play back the sound:

![Compilation Error in FScape Code Editor](.../tut-paulstretch-audio-file-view.png)

Before you can hear the sound when pressing the play-button, the audio system must be started, by pressing
the _Boot_ button in Mellite's main window. If you haven't done yet, you must make sure that SuperCollider is
configured in the preferences, as every real-time sound production goes through SuperCollider. In Mellite's
preferences, select the _Audio_ tab, and edit the _SuperCollider (scsynth)_ setting if necessary. On Linux, it
can usually remain on the default _<SC_HOME>_, but on Mac and Windows you must point it explicitly to the
`scynth` or `scsynth.exe` program. Once you manage to boot the audio system and press the play button in the
audio file viewer, you should hear the playback and see the output meter moving in the main window:

![Compilation Error in FScape Code Editor](.../tut-paulstretch-audio-system-booted.png)

## Reading and Writing Audio Files in FScape

Let us now __return to the FScape code editor__. We are going to write the first program that transforms an existing 
audio file. The program will begin with a UGen that reads the existing (input) audio file, and it will end with a 
UGen that writes a new (output) audio file. The transform consists of a "normalization", i.e. we apply the maximum 
gain so that the signal range does not exceed -1.0 to +1.0, making the signal maximally loud while avoiding digital 
clipping. In the first step, let's measure the maximum amplitude of the input signal:

```scala
val in        = AudioFileIn("in")
val chanMax   = RunningMax(in.abs).last
chanMax .poll("chan-max")   // print the amplitude of each channel
val totalMax  = Reduce.max(chanMax)
totalMax.poll("total-max")  // print the maximum input amplitude
```

Before we can run the program, we must provide the input audio file location. Note how
`AudioFileIn` uses a string parameter---`"in"`---to refer to this location.
This is a __key__ into the __attribute map__ of the FScape object, where the actual file location will be
looked up when running the program. This way, we avoid having to hard-code file paths in the program, and later
we can link this key to a user interface component as well.

@@@ note { title=Scala }

String literals in Scala have to be enclosed in double quotes `"..."`, just as in Java or SuperCollider.
Anther similarity are line comments which begin with double forward slashes `// ...`. Comments are purely
informative to the reader, they are ignored by the compiler.

@@@

We can freely choose the key, but we must be careful that a corresponding entry actually exist. For example,
if we save and run (render) the above program, there will be an error:

> java.lang.RuntimeException: AudioFileIn missing attribute in

To create the necessary entry, we first open the attribute map of the FScape object. Go back to the main
workspace window, select the FScape object in the list and click on button with the wrench-shaped icon to open
the corresponding attribute map.

@@@ note

In Mellite, every object possesses an attribute map, as a way to specify its behaviour and make links between
different objects. Some attributes have predefined meanings, for example `"name"` points to the given name of
an object. Other attributes are defined by the user, with their keys being freely chosen.

@@@

We had already added the test audio file to the workspace, and now we need to associate it with the `"in"` key
of the FScape attribute map: Press on the audio file entry in the main workspace window, keep the button pressed
and move the mouse over the attribute map view, finding a position at the bottom of a row. You should see the
mouse pointer change to a drag-and-drop pointer, and a thick line on the attribute map view indicates the drop
position. Release the mouse button. A dialog pops up to specify the key name. Enter `in` and confirm. The new
entry appears next to the existing entries for `name` and `graph-source` (this is where the source code of the
FScape program is located!):

![Drag-and-Drop of the Audio File onto the FScape Attribute Map](.../tut-paulstretch-dnd-to-attr.png)

![Updated Attribute Map](.../tut-paulstretch-link-in-to-attr.png)

@@@ note

I am aware of the ergonomic challenge in this drag-and-drop operation.
In the future, it is planned to make this association gesture easier, both in terms of mouse usage, but also
adding keyboard equivalents. If you have any suggestions how to increase the usability, please let me know.

@@@

Now try clicking _Render_ again. The program should run, and output the individual channel amplitudes and the 
overall amplitude to the log window:

    chan-max: 0.26682332158088684
    chan-max: 0.22031311690807343
    total-max: 0.26682332158088684

Let's analyse the code in more depth:

```scala
val in        = AudioFileIn("in")
val chanMax   = RunningMax(in.abs).last
chanMax .poll("chan-max")   // print the amplitude of each channel
val totalMax  = Reduce.max(chanMax)
totalMax.poll("total-max")  // print the maximum input amplitude
```

The first UGen should be clear now---it reads in an audio file by looking at the entry with key `"in"` in the 
containing object's attribute map, expecting to find an audio file object there. The second line is actually
comprised of three UGens: `in.abs` creates a `UnaryOp` UGen which operates on a sample-by-sample level, applying
a particular operator, here the `abs` function that takes away the sign of each sample value, so an input sequence
of `-0.1, 0.3, 0.5, -0.4` would become `0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.4`. This is because we are looking for the largest
sample value to either side of the oscillation, above zero or below zero. The absolute values are then fed into
the `RunningMax` UGen, which simply remembers the largest value it has ever seen up and until any moment in time,
so if the input sequence was `0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.4`, it would output `0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.5`.

The result of this fed into `.last` which is shorthand for `.takeRight(1)`. The `TakeRight` UGen drops all input 
sample values except for the last ones. This is an important difference to the real-time signal processing in
SuperCollider, for example. In FScape, signals can have finite durations, and UGens do not have to output the
same number of values as they take as their inputs. It is easier to view signals in FScape as if they were
collection of numbers, on which one can perform typical collection operations such as truncating the sequence,
sorting or reversing it, etc. This has some consequences for the design of programs to avoid that the signal flow
"gets stuck", as we shall see soon.

In short, the second line computes that maximum absolute value of the input signal. The third line calls the `.poll`
function which produces as a `Poll` UGen that prints values from its input signals to the post window. As we
do not specify a frequency of polling, it only prints a single time, that is the first value of the input signal.
The string argument `"chan-max"` is a label, so that we can distinguish the output of multiple `Poll` instances.
Because `chanMax` has already been truncated to a single value---the last element of the `RunningMax` UGen---we
effectively print out the maximum amplitude across the entire input audio file.
 
But there is more to it as you can see from the output: With the given test audio file, we see two values printed,
`0.2668` and `0.2203`. This is because in FScape, signals can be comprised of more than one channel. In fact,
FScape uses the same principle of __multi-channel expansion__ as SuperCollider. Internally, whenever a signal contains
more than one channel, the signal process just passes each channel through its own copy of the UGens in the program,
so in our case there will be two `.abs` UGens, two `RunningMax` UGens, two `.last` UGens, and two `.poll("chanMax")`
UGens!

When normalizing an audio file, we usually want to adjust the gain of all channels by the same value, otherwise we
would alter the spatial balance between the channels. We therefore need a way to ensure that a multi-channel signal
is reduced to a single-channel signal. This is precisely what the `Reduce` UGen does. It comes in several variants,
such as `Reduce.+`, `Reduce.min`, `Reduce.max`, specifying how values across channels are combined. As you can see,
`Reduce.max` took the maximum of the two channels `0.2668` and `0.2203`, and output a single value `0.2668`---the
higher of the two amplitudes.

----

Now that we know the maximum amplitude, we can complete the program by calculating the normalising gain factor and
writing the output audio file:

```scala
val in        = AudioFileIn("in")
val chanMax   = RunningMax(in.abs).last
val totalMax  = Reduce.max(chanMax)
val gain      = 1.0 / totalMax
val sig       = in * gain
AudioFileOut("out", sig, sampleRate = in.sampleRate)
```

The gain factor is simply the reciprocal of the maximum amplitude found in the input. So `1.0 / 0.2668` is 
`3.7477`, and if all input sample values are multiplied by that factor, the maximum output amplitude is thus
`0.2668 * 3.7477 = 1.0`. You can also see that we can multiple a multi-channel signal (`in`) with a single-channel
signal (`gain`). Again, this works like multi-channel-expansion in SuperCollider: The result will have the maximum
number of channel found (here two), and in the `BinaryOp`---the UGen produced by the `*` operator---the first
and only channel of `gain` is used for both channels of `in`. Finally, writing the output file looks similar to
reading the input file; we specify again a key, now `"out"`, for the UGen to look up the file reference in the 
attribute map; the second argument is the signal to be written, and there are additional arguments for the 
audio file format, which we left at the default (the file will have AIFF format and 32-bit floating point sample
resolution) except for the `sampleRate`. We use `in.sampleRate` to make the output
file match the input file's sampling rate.

@@@ note { title=Scala }

You can see all arguments to `AudioFileOut` by searching for this symbol in the API documentation browser
(menu _Help → API Documentation_). From the alternatives choose package `de.sciss.fscape.lucre.graph`. In Scala,
methods and class constructors can use default arguments, and here they are given for `fileType`, `sampleFormat`,
and `sampleRate`. To skip parameters in the use site, we can name the arguments, such as `sampleRate = ...` which
means that the first two argument values, `"out"` and `sig`, are aligned with the first two arguments of the class,
`key` and `in`, and then we "jump" to the fifth argument `sampleRate`. It is good style to use named arguments
also in cases where you do not jump across arguments but just want to make clear which argument is which.

@@@

The creation of the entry for `"out"` is slightly different because this time the audio file does not exist yet.
The object needed here is internally called _Artifact_, and in the Mellite user interface simply _File_. Let's
create it directly within the attribute map editor for the FScape object. Click the plus button and from the popup
menu select `Resources → File`. In the dialog you can either type the file path directly into the _Value_ text field,
e.g. `/home/foo/Documents/normalized.aif`, or press the ellipsis button `...` to select from a file chooser.
After confirming, you need to give the key name, thus `out`.

![Updated Attribute Map](.../tut-paulstretch-link-out-to-attr.png)

If we now render the new program, we will see... _exactly nothing_. The `Render` button just remains disabled,
the abort-rendering button with the x-shaped icon remains enabled. __The program is stuck.__ Unfortunately, in
the current architecture it is quite easy to accidentally produce programs that hang, which is due to the fact
that there are "diamond problems" in the code. A diamond problem happens when a UGen _A_ is used by two different
signal branches _B_ and _C_, and then a UGen _D_ in turn uses both _B_ and _C_. This works only as long as branches
_B_ and _C_ use the same processing throughput, but as soon as for example _B_ introduces a delay, we get into
trouble. It is beyond this tutorial, but if you press the _Debug_ button and look at the DOT graph which is printed
to the log window, you may spot this problem:

![GraphViz plot of the Diamond Problem](.../tut-paulstretch-diamond-problem.png)

Note that the duplicate inner branches show the automatic stereo expansion, but are not the cause of the problem.
The two nodes of the diamond problem are `AudioFileIn` on one end, and the multiplication `BinaryOp` on the other
end; in short, the line `val sig = in * gain` causes the hanging, because `gain` is only available
_after the entire signal `in` has been read_---obviously, because we only know the maximum amplitude at the very
end!---, but the multiplication would require that we can both scan `in` from the beginning and have `gain` available.
This is technically impossible, unless there was some magical automatic buffering happening.

@@@ note

FScape is still considered experimental in many respects. One of the aspects that should be addressed in the
future, is to at least automatically _detect_ these diamond problems and give the user help resolving them.
As of now, the best you can do when you run into these problems, is to ask on the Gitter channel.

@@@

To fix this we could either:

- Introduce an auxiliary buffer, `val sig = BufferDisk(in) * gain`. This creates an arbitrary long buffer for
  the `in` signal by writing it to a temporary file.
- Since the file is already on disk, we could just read it again: `val sig = AudioFileIn("in") * gain`. In the
  DOT diagram above, the consequence would be that the blue 'shouldPull' lines down from the `BinaryOp(*)`s
  are removed, as they are now connected to an independent duplicate of `AudioFileIn`.
- A variant of the second idea is to change `val in` to `def in`, which means that whenever we refer to `in`,
  we create a fresh `AudioFileIn` UGen.

So the fixed program becomes

```scala
def in        = AudioFileIn("in")  // using def now!
val chanMax   = RunningMax(in.abs).last
val totalMax  = Reduce.max(chanMax)
val gain      = 1.0 / totalMax
val sig       = in * gain
AudioFileOut("out", sig, sampleRate = in.sampleRate)
```

Now `in` is called three times, first when calculating the amplitude, next when calculating the
normalized signal, and a third time when querying the sampling rate `in.sampleRate`. The last call is inexpensive,
however, as it does not stream the whole signal but just retrieves the audio file header.

@@@ note { title=Scala }

While a `val a = b` means that the right-hand-side expression `b` is evaluated once and the result assigned to `a`,
the method definition `def a = b` means that _whenever_ we refer to `a`, the expression `b` is evaluated anew.
If `b` is a constant, there is no difference between `val a` and `def a`, however in FScape, expressions
such as `AudioFileIn(...)` place the UGen in the signal graph, so if we evaluate that expression twice, we actually
create two independent instances of the UGen.

@@@

## PaulStretch in FScape

After this long haul, I want to dump the entire program first, so can experiment with it and render an
actual sound, before taking it apart and explaining the steps:

```scala
val in          = AudioFileIn("in")
val winSizeSec  = 1.0 // window size in seconds
val stretch     = 8.0 // stretch factor
val N           = 4   // output window overlap
val sr          = in.sampleRate
val numFramesIn = in.numFrames
val winSize     = (winSizeSec * sr).roundTo(1).max(1)
val stepSizeOut = (winSize / N).roundTo(1).max(1)
val stepSizeIn  = (winSize / (N * stretch)).roundTo(1).max(1)
val numStepsIn  = (numFramesIn / stepSizeIn).ceil
val numFramesOut= (numStepsIn - 1).max(0) * stepSizeOut + winSize
val slidIn      = Sliding(in, size = winSize, step = stepSizeIn)
val winAna      = GenWindow(winSize, shape = GenWindow.Hann)
val inW         = slidIn * winAna
val fftSize     = winSize.nextPowerOfTwo
val fft         = Real1FFT(inW, winSize, padding = fftSize - winSize)
val mag         = fft.complex.mag
val phase       = WhiteNoise(math.Pi)
val real        = mag * phase.cos
val imag        = mag * phase.sin
val rand        = real zip imag
val ifft        = Real1IFFT(rand, fftSize)
val slidOut     = ResizeWindow(ifft, fftSize, stop = winSize - fftSize)
val winSyn      = GenWindow(winSize, shape = GenWindow.Hann)
val outW        = slidOut * winSyn
val lap         = OverlapAdd(outW, size = winSize, step = stepSizeOut)
val lapTrim     = lap.take(numFramesOut)
val maxAmp      = RunningMax(Reduce.max(lapTrim.abs)).last
val gain        = 1.0 / maxAmp
val norm        = BufferDisk(lapTrim) * gain
AudioFileOut("out", norm, sampleRate = sr)
```

If you run this with the example bell audio file, the result should sound like this:
